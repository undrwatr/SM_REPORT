# SM_REPORT

This is a script to pull data out of the Meraki cloud for the Systems Manager section. There are a lot more fields that can be pulled from the Devices section you just have to specify the additional information that you want to pull. It took me a little while to pull this and I didn't find great examples so I decided to post what I am using to pull the reports and then send them off. This example is used to pull the last connected date and put it into a CSV to send of to a list of users.
